How the 10-Level Earnings Tree Works
Imagine you’re at the top. Here’s how commissions flow down the tree for a single sale (let’s say a 100 USDT package for easy math):
You (Top)
│
├─ Level 1: 40 USDT (Direct referral)
│   └─ Level 2: 10 USDT
│        └─ Level 3: 7 USDT
│             └─ Level 4: 5 USDT
│                  └─ Level 5: 4 USDT
│                       └─ Level 6: 3 USDT
│                            └─ Level 7: 3 USDT
│                                 └─ Level 8: 3 USDT
│                                      └─ Level 9: 3 USDT

You refer Alice → You get 40 USDT (Level 1)
Alice refers Bob → Alice gets 40 USDT, you get 10 USDT (Level 2)
Bob refers Carol → Bob gets 40 USDT, Alice gets 10 USDT, you get 7 USDT (Level 3)
...and so on, all the way to Level 10!
You earn on every sale in your downline, up to 10 levels deep. The deeper your network, the more you make!
Pro tip: Build wide and deep for maximum earnings.
Potential Earnings Tree (2 Referrals Each)
If everyone refers just 2 people and each person makes one sale per day, here’s what your network and daily earnings could look like for a 100 USDT package:
Level 0:         You
                │
Level 1:      ┌─●───────────────●─┐
             40 USDT         40 USDT
                │               │
Level 2:   ●───●───●       ●───●───●
           10   10  10     10   10  10
                │               │
Level 3: 7  7  7  7  7   7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7
... (continues to Level 10)
        
Potential Earnings Per Level (if all sales are 100 USDT and everyone refers 2):
Level	People	Commission %	Commission per Sale	Total Daily Potential
1	2	40%	40 USDT	80 USDT
2	4	10%	10 USDT	40 USDT
3	8	7%	7 USDT	56 USDT
